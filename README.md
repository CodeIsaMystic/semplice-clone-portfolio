## Getting Started

Semplice-theme is a simple design portfolio for frontend developer, inspired and more than that, following a kind of "design & structure guidelines" from the Vandana Pai's own portfolio, a senior product designer working at Spotify. Of course you can visit her site [lifeofpai.com](http://lifeofpai.com/), which I believe representing a perfect model of student case explanations, and efficient minimalist design ...

Inroducing myself, I'm Julien as Jowd another "unknown developer", self-educated from France, trying to upgrade my skills and experience learning with some of the best personnalities, professionnals, projects and contents I think we have chance to cross over the web.

## Dependencies

### Webpack, Babel, PostCSS...

I used on this project some of the most populars node packages to my workflow, you can easily have a look on package.json file. All the configuration, settings and scripts are defined on the webpack.config.js

## Case Study, for student case...

On project#.html files, I've tried to demonstrate some parts of problems I've worked on in a 3 projects choice. I focused only on 3 projects to have a better explanation to job I made, to add more details on what I've done sure but also on what I think it's important. Giving a overview of different topics, good approaches & practices. The Vai's website was a usefull helper to structure my work on those sections. 

## Design 

Reading the Vai's Design was a nice experience, because it's so clean, with lots of "air space", defining patterns in a really great way. The components are clearly designed, the layouts are clean and the hard parts was to define a grid because of the richness and mix of patterns so different from each other. 
I used the B.E.M Methodology, the S.M.A.C.S.S files architecture and various notions of designing websites attempting to have in mind a great visual of her design.
